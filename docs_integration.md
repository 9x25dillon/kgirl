# NewThought + UnifiedCoherenceRecovery Integration

## Overview
Bidirectional bridge between symbolic thought engine and neural coherence recovery.

## Domain Mappings
| Primary | Recovery | Type |
|--------|----------|------|
| `coherence_score` | `kappa[alpha]` (dominant) | Distribution |
| `depth` | `dominant_band` | Direct |
| `entropy` | `falloff_width` | Modulation |

## API
```python
recovered = await bridge.recover_entity(thought, timestamp)
