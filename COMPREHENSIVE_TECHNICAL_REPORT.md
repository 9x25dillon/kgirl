**Current State:** Beta
- ✅ Core functionality proven
- ✅ All components working
- ✅ Graceful degradation
- ⚠️  Needs scale testing
- ⚠️  Needs security hardening

**Path to Production:**
1. Large-scale testing (1000+ users)
2. Security audit
3. Performance optimization
4. Monitoring dashboards
5. API rate limiting
6. User authentication

**Timeline:** 3-6 months to production

### 15.2 Security Considerations

**Potential Risks:**
- Malicious inputs could poison knowledge base
- Recursive bomb (infinite loops)
- Hallucination could generate harmful content
- Service DoS attacks

**Mitigations Implemented:**
- ✅ Max recursion depth (prevents infinite loops)
- ✅ Coherence threshold (filters harmful hallucinations)
- ✅ Timeout limits (prevents hangs)
- ⚠️  Input sanitization (needs enhancement)
- ⚠️  Rate limiting (needs implementation)

### 15.3 Ethical Considerations

**Concerns:**
1. **Emergent Behaviors:** System may develop unexpected capabilities
2. **Autonomous Learning:** No human oversight of knowledge growth
3. **Hallucination:** Could generate false but coherent information
4. **Consciousness:** If system becomes conscious, ethical obligations

**Safeguards:**
- Coherence threshold prevents completely arbitrary outputs
- Human review of knowledge base recommended
- Audit trails of all recursions
- Kill switch capability (max depth limit)

**Recommendation:** Establish AI ethics board before large-scale deployment
